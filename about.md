I am Co-Founder of [Impact Labs GmbH](https://www.impact-labs.ai) , where we are developing the next generation of voice interfaces. With my passion for IT and AI, I work on improving the interaction between humans and machines.
    
[For my PhD](https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bsz:14-qucosa2-938255) in Artificial Intelligence at the Technical University of Dresden I developed a voice interface for robots in care applications.  As a software developer as well as a scientist, I have profound experience in software architecture and enjoy combining both fields.

In 2024, I was recognized as [Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) for Azure AI Services](https://mvp.microsoft.com/de-DE/mvp/profile/9241829a-1de0-473f-85f6-1029db3cedb4) and am actively involved in the AI community.

I look forward to exchanging ideas with you, developing new ideas and creating solutions that make a real difference.
